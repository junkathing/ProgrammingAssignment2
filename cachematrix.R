## makeCacheMatrix wraps a matrix into a list.  This list contains containing a function to
##       1. set the value of the matrix
##       2. get the value of the matrix
##       3. set the value of the inverse matrix
##       4. get the value of the inverse matrix

## cacheSolve is a extension of the normal solve function which "keeps a cache of the mapping 
## from arguments to results and, when calls with the same arguments are repeated often, has 
## higher performance at the expense of higher memory use."

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        m <- x$getsolve()

                message("getting cached data")
                return(m)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        m <- solve(data, ...)
